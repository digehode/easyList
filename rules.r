p433
VA unit that contains at least one model with this special rule that is locked in combat can choose to leave close combat at the end of any Assault phase. If the unit wishes to do so, it must take an Initiative test.\u000a\u000aIf the test is failed, nothing happens and the models remain locked in the fight. If the test is passed, choose a direction - then roll 3D6. As long as the distance rolled, in inches, is sufficient to allow the entire unit to move over 1"away from all of the enemy units they are engaged in combat with, the unit breaks away from combat and immediately moves a number of inches in the chosen direction equal to the 3D6 result, ignoring the units they were locked in combat with. No Sweeping Advance rolls are made. Enemy units that are no longer locked in combat immediately Consolidate D6".\u000a\u000aA Hit & Run move is not slowed by difficult terrain, but treats dangerous terrain normally. It may not be used to move into contact with enemy units, and models instead stop 1" away.

If the last of these ends up no longer in combat, it Consolidates instead.(Source: 40k Rulebook, p.38)

sVFeel No Pain
p645
VWhen a model with this special rule suffers an unsaved Wound, it can make a special Feel No Pain roll to avoid being wounded (this is not a saving throw). Roll a D6 each time an unsaved Wound is suffered. On a 4 or less, you must take the Wound as normal. On a 5+, the unsaved Wound is discounted - treat it as having been saved.\u000a\u000aNot that Feel No Pain rolls cannot be made against unsaved Wounds that inflict Instant Death. \u000a\u000aIf a unit has the Feel No Pain special rule with a number in brackets aftwerwards - Feel No Pain (6+), for example - then the number in brackets is the D6 result needed to discount the Wound.\u000a\u000aIf one or more models in a unit have the Feel No Pain special rule then the Mixed Saves method of Wound allocation should always be used for allocating Wounds and removing casualties from that unit; Feel No Pain rolls should be individually made after each failed save.\u000a\u000aFAQ: Feel No Pain can be used to resist a Wound suffered from Perils of the Warp. Eternal Warrior does not allow Feel No Pain to be rolled against Wounds that inflict Instant Death. Force Weapon activation is made before determining whether or not a victim is permitted a Feel No Pain roll. (Source: ??)
